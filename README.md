As initially described by @owocki on Twitter, 

SCUBI-DOOS (short for Smart Contract UBI for Developers of Open Source) is a project to build a collection of smart contract based tools that allow for a developer-focused skills-based UBI, in which a pool of funds could be distributed to developers with a given demonstrated skill. 



Potential scope of projects includes:

- smart contract distribution of rewards from a pool
- implementation of quadratic voting/CLR distribution of rewards pools, which could be used to reward more indemand skills
- online tests or accreditations with onchcain completion proof (potentially via NFTs)
- Referral programs and affiliate incentives that encourage any contributor to help find on-chain paid opportunities for the talent pool.
- Ways to onboard or educate/empower individuals to develop a technical skill set.
- Integration with Sablier for automatic streaming of payments to any hired contributors.

Further updates will be added to the github in the next couple of days
